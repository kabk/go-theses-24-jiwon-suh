						<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
						<p>
							In this digital age of constant chase towards the ‘new’ and the constant bombarding of news of cutting-edge technology, my urge to explore an object of the mundane, still, and obsolete at times, had always been in the back of my mind for a period of time. During the time of my arrival back to the Netherlands after spending 11 months in my home country, I unravel the evocative power of clothing through old pictures from my childhood. The introspection solidifies my will to explore worn garments not only on a personal level but also dig deeper about this subject through narratives of used clothing in the works by author in the realm of art and design. The essay aims to answer the question: how does worn garments play their role as an evocative tool and serve as tangible portals to memories, shaping artistic expressions and personal identities, and contributing to a broader societal narrative?
						</p>
						<p>
							I embark on the journey of rediscovering worn clothing by visiting ECHO. Wrapped in Memory exhibition at MoMu in Antwerp. Throughout the chapters, I analyze works by Louise Bourgeois, Chiharu Shiota, and Elisa van Joolen, serving as poignant case studies that explores the relationship between clothing and memory. Bourgeois opens up a new perspective on used garments by exhibiting her own clothes that are intertwined with childhood trauma. Shiota broadens the narrative by embracing collective memory accumulated through people’s shoes and personal stories, encapsulating the interconnected human experiences. Joolen introduces a unique perspective through individual and collective values associated with worn garments of workshop participants, delving deeper into broader economic and social contexts.
						</p>
						<p>
							Each case study opens up a new perspective to worn clothing closely intertwined with memories that is often overlooked in our future-oriented society. The research highlights the role of clothing as a medium not only for personal expression but also as a catalyst for collective memory within society, opening genuine conversations on personal narratives and societal issues.

							Amid a fast-paced, forward-thinking society, I felt a gradual disconnect from my innate sensitivity to both external stimuli and the intricacies within myself. I have always been sensitive to my own feelings and sentiment, especially when it comes to nostalgia. This deeply rooted sentimental longing for the past has been part of my identity for most of my life because I moved around a lot as a child. My attachment with the past is a big segment of my identity and the sentimental emotions that arise when I think about it are what help me with my creative process, and I feel like I have been losing them lately. It was when I came back to the Netherlands 11 months after my exchange semester and internship in Korea and took out the photos that were originally on the wall in my room to put them back where they were before. I took a good look at the
							<span class="image-anchor" data-image-id="reveal1">three photos</span>
							of me when I was two with my parents and was taken aback at the fact that I remember how my mother put these clothes on me and how they snugged my body to protect me from the cold, snowy Korean winter. Recalling the tactile, sensory, olfactory, and visual sensations of the clothes gave me a jumpstart on painting a clearer picture of my memory. The smell, people, buildings that surrounded me in that moment gradually unfolded. Occasionally, I would visit
							<span class="image-anchor" data-image-id="reveal2">my father’s photo journal archive</span><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
							and looking at the photos from my childhood, I would distinctly remember most of the clothes I wore and the specific moments in the past tied to each one of them.

						<p>
							When I heard this quote, I could not relate more to it. Subsequently, I realized clothing can serve as a potent mnemonic tool to explore one’s memories and experiences and to further explore evocative clothing in the realm of art and design in both personal contexts and broader global contexts. Fashion is all about the new, constantly accelerating towards producing something new. To stand still, to rest, is to be out of fashion. However, as I discover this evocative power inherent in the stories of old and worn clothes, a quality that is truly irreplaceable, I hereby take the opportunity to delve into the potential of emotionally resonant clothing and its profound significance. This exploration involves an analysis of three exemplary works created by artists and designers who actively engage with worn garments.

							Clothing is one of the most intimate things in our lives. It is what we wear closest to our skin. We do not always think about it, but we allow only few other items to come into such direct contact without skin. Our memories, too, are intimate, personal, and subjective. They are tinted by positive or negative emotions, sometimes also by trauma, loss, or fear, and can be evoked by smell, color or tactility. All of this is why clothing is an ideal carrier of and portal to our memories.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> To familiarize myself with the intricacies of the unfolding concept at hand, I chose to experience firsthand the works that encapsulate this idea. During my winter break of 2023, I visited this exhibition titled
							<span class="image-anchor" data-image-id="reveal4">ECHO. Wrapped in Memory</span>
							at MoMu, a fashion museum located in Antwerp, Belgium. As MoMu eloquently explains their vision, “Fashion is more than clothing, and more than “fashion”. It’s a prism to look at the world from different angles. One of the roles of contemporary fashion is to push the meaning of the term “fashion” and move beyond the canonized narratives of fashion history. People need a place where fashion is subject to reflection and criticism. A haven to calmly observe the philosophy and dynamics behind fashion, its history, and its future. A place to explore what fashion is, and what it does to us.”<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> An exhibition that could not be more perfectly aligned with the theme I am exploring, ECHO. Wrapped in Memory explores the relationship between clothing and memory through the lens of Louise Bourgeois, Simone Rocha, and Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker.

							ECHO’s set designer, Janina Pedan, meticulously designed the
							<span class="image-anchor" data-image-id="reveal5">space</span>
							to evoke memories not only by the artworks, clothes, stories, but also through the materiality, acoustics, lighting, to bring out the ultimate evocative experience. When you enter the first room of the exhibition, the space greets you with pitch black walls and ceiling and several spotlights shining onto

							The black walls of the rooms impart a sensation akin to being enveloped within a mother’s womb, while the gentle, subdued illumination filling the entire exhibition space imparts a comforting ambiance. This recurring warm lighting evokes a sense of solace, often accompanied by an intertwined sentiment of nostalgia–a complex emotion that intertwines pleasure with a subtle undercurrent of melancholy. Then, you walk through a
							<span class="image-anchor" data-image-id="reveal7">tunnel draped with red velveted curtains</span>, leading to a bigger space where the exploration embarks. The deliberate design choices for the set, aptly establish the ideal ambience for the exhibition, allowing the viewers to be completely immersed in the journey of memory.

						<p>
							Bourgeois describes her good and bad days to colors: pink and blue. We all have our good days and bad days. On her pink days she felt an intense surge of femininity, creativity, optimism, positivity, and affirmation, while blue days were days of melancholy, contemplation, and withdrawal. Bourgeois uses her own old garments transfused with the memories of good and bad, days of the past tinted with pink and blue. Clothes were a source of joy and even greater friction to her for a long time. As quoted in Charlie Porter’s What Artists Wear, in 1969 Bourgeois wrote in her notes, “it gives me great pleasure to keep my clothes, my dresses, my stockings... It’s my past, and as rotten as it is I would like to take it and hold it tight in my arms.”<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>  The quote clearly depicts Bourgeois’ unique love for her clothes and the memories wrapped in them. Later she describes these possessions as burdensome, representing “failures, rejects abandoned.” Pink Days and Blue Days explores her childhood and her family history, in particular, the traumatic impact of her parents’ troubled marriage and her father’s affair. According to Bourgeois, the bones that hang the lace baby gown in this work represent the “bone of contention”<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> which symbolizes the rivalry between her parents to earn her affection by buying her clothing. As Charlie Porter further explains, “Bourgeois was in tune with the emotion and trauma that we instill in our clothes, and the toll of letting them go.”<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Pink Days and Blue Days is the perfect embodiment of the human experience in which we try to hold onto clothes and the memories of the pink of the pink days but also, the inevitable desire to rid of those from the blue days exists. In 1995, Bourgeois finally managed to let them go, transferring most of her clothes to her studio where she could turn them into raw, sculptural material which allowed the weight of the past to be lifted: "the cord was cut and I felt dizzy – the history of the wardrobe had started.”<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> The act of letting go comes with great therapeutic release, the trauma and the clothes, which brought a psychological shift in her, emancipating herself from her childhood. Jerry Gorovoy, Bourgeois’ studio assistant, who helped her to bring the contents of the upstairs wardrobes down to her basement studio said Bourgeois’s deep urge to embark on this new body of work came from her getting older and wondering what would happen to all the objects she had saved throughout her life. I, a self-proclaimed hoarder, often imagine what I will do with the miscellany have had been cherished by me. In this case, Bourgeois sets a great example by taking her childhood artefacts that are linked to deep-seated emotions and memories into a powerful evocative work. This not only serves as a therapeutic means for her to confront and release childhood trauma and complexities but also serves as a catalyst for meaningful conversations among audiences about all kinds of memory, both good and bad, both simple and the complex. Her creation conveys a comforting message, emphasizing the strength derived from exploring and liberating one’s past.

							by Chiharu Shiota. She is an Osaka-born, Berlin-based artist that explores intangible concepts such as memory, dreams, anxiety, and silence. Clothing holds profound significance in Shiota’s works, serving as a symbolic conduit for personal and collective memories. Knotted threads are also a primary material present throughout her installations, which have become her signature, questioning notions of human existence and transcendence.

							For <span class="image-anchor" data-image-id="reveal13">Sackler Gallery’s Perspective series,</span> Shiota filled a corner of a room with nearly 400 single-paired shoes with stories from 400 individuals and 4 miles of yarn.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> Although many half-pairs seem like a group of people imitating Cinderella, the shoes hold more significance than mere discarded objects. Old shoes and yarn may not be the most sophisticated instruments when looked at individually. However, in unison, they create a powerful evocative synergy as to exploring the theme of collective memory in this work, evoking subtle melancholy and feelings of loneliness and nostalgia. Each shoe carries a unique story from the past. The shoes are pointed outward as if to seem like they will “go over the continent,” but all the memory of shoes shared by individuals are connected and held back by red yarn, representing emotional ties of humanity. This exploration extends beyond the individual, emphasizing the broader significance of connecting humanity as a unified entity in its progression. Shiota skillfully uses yarn to symbolize the intricate nature of human relationships, acknowledging that, like yarn, these connections can be easily tangled, severed, and loosened. Over the Continents aptly conveys a message to the audience to consider the life of an object that may seem obsolete and the fundamental ties that connect humans to one another, offering a unique perspective in our forward-thinking society, where the pursuit of new technologies and products often takes precedence.

							by Elisa van Joolen. This work delves not only into the evocative and emotional value of clothing, but also explores these aspects within a broader economic context. PORTAL is an ongoing research project lead by Elisa van Joolen that explores connections between personal, economic, social, and cultural values of garments worn by people.<a href="#fn19"

The cover of PORTAL 005 immediately caught my eye: sans serif letters in all caps asking the question “IS IT YOURS?”, followed by the response of “48 say: yes, none say: no.” Thanks to Bart, I had the opportunity to physically read through each page and immerse myself in the content. PORTAL 005 is the result of the PORTAL 005 workshop that took place during the exhibition Don’t Feed the Monster! At Galleri F 15, Moss Norway.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> During this workshop, Elisa van Joolen conducted a new version of the PORTAL workshop, investigating the emotional, social, and economic value of clothing worn by exhibition visitors.

							The objective of PORTAL is not for academic or scientific research, but to rather provide an <span class="image-anchor" data-image-id="reveal16">insightful data through exploring personal values and experiences regarding the garments.</span> 						
							Joolen further explains that “In opposition to the hierarchical value production of today’s branding focused fashion industry, PORTAL brings to the surface values from real wearers of worn garments. Wears that feel the garments, take care of them, damage them, give them away gifts and interact with the wearers.”<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> She goes beyond cherishing the personal values embedded in each garment and the stories shared by individuals. She also emphasizes the broader significance of accumulated narratives woven into the worn clothes of the participants in PORTAL, exploring them within a wider economic and social context through the resting garment. Joolen links this image of a ‘resting garment’ to Jonathan Cray’s idea of sleep against the accelerated lifestyle of how sleep is an interval of time that is profoundly useless for capitalism as it creates losses in circulation and consumption.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> This ‘sleeping garment’ disrupts the flow of time, creating losses in circulation thus consumption, in which this ‘pause’ further questions our choices in this fast-paced fashion realm. The act becomes a starting point for reconsidering the fashion system. Typically, we would see clothes worn on people, and when not being worn, they are stored by hanging in closets, neatly folded in drawers, or casually thrown onto a chair. The repositioning of the garment allows the wearer to scrutinize the garment from a new angle and allows us to ponder on the backstory of the clothing such as the production process, waste, labor exploitation, and beyond. The participants of the workshop are asked to answer questions about their resting clothes regarding its production, materials, ownership, and value. The following questions in order are asked to the participants of the PORTAL workshop. What is it? What is the material? What is the color? What is the brand? Where is it made? Which year did you buy/get it? Is it a gift? Is it new or second-hand? How much did it cost? Did you buy it online or offline? How often do you wear it? How do you take care of it? What is its emotional value? Who made it? How much would you pay for it today? Is it yours? How old are you? How do you feel when you wear it? And lastly, why did you wear it today?<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a>

						<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
						<p>
							In conclusion, these narratives in works that are created through the lens of artists and designers unravels a captivating insight into the relationship between clothing and memory. These works highlight on the emotional and evocative power encapsulated within old and worn garments. Analyzing the works gives more in-depth understanding towards evocative clothing which was embarked from a personal revelation of mine when I discovered the mnemonic qualities worn clothings posses when looking at pictures from my childhood. Combined with my gradual disconnect from my innate internal intricacies, especially with the feeling of nostalgia, it allowed me to explore to rediscover the role of worn clothing within the field of art and design. Visiting ECHO. Wrapped in Memory exhibition at MoMu in Antwerp was the perfect starting point in embarking my journey of exploring evocative clothing and smoothly aided me to acquaint myself with artists like Louise Bourgeois who passionately explores her past and memories through her own clothes in the form of art.
						</p>
						<p>
							Louise Bourgeois’ Pink Days and Blue days is a poignant embodiment of the emotional journey of releasing garments intertwined with childhood trauma. The juxtaposition of pink and blue days encapsulates Bourgeois’ memories both the good and the bad as she explains she feels a burst of femininity, creativity, optimism on her pink days and a hint of melancholy, contemplation, and withdrawal on her blue days. She further commiserates the audience through her work that these amalgamation of feelings and emotions tied together from the past can be released in the form of art.
						</p>
						<p>
							Chiharu Shiota’s Over the Continents expands the exploration of worn clothing with collective memory, inviting the public to donate their shoes for her installation work. The donated half-pair shoes come with notes attached, each person and each shoe with a different story. The installation of array of shoes wrapped in vibrant red yarn symbolizes the interconnectedness of human experiences. Shiota’s work serves as a powerful commentary on binding humanity together and the often-overlooked stories behind seemingly mundane, sometimes obsolete, garments.
						</p>
						<p>
							Elisa van Joolen’s ongoing project, PORTAL, takes a distinctive approach by exploring individual and collective values attached to worn garments within a broader economical context. In the workshop, the participants are asked to rest down one of the worn items which opens up conversations about the personal narratives and experiences of the clothing and further contributing to a visual map of interconnected, shared values among the participants. This workshop poses questions about the contemporary fashion industry, offering a more authentic and piercing perspective on both the personal values and economic aspects of clothing. 
						</p>
						<p>
							In essence, each expression within the realm of art and design delves into the role of clothing as a tangible vessel to memories and experiences. By analyzing these three works presented above, it allowed me to broaden my perspective on the role of clothing and reconsider the fast-paced nature and its intricacies of the fashion realm. The essay further prompts conversations about the intersection of personal narratives and societal issues, emphasizing the role of clothing as a powerful medium that not only reflects individual identities but also contributes to the collective memory of humanity. Through these works, intricate connections between individuals, their garments, and the broader fashion system in this modern world are explored, opening a new path of exploration within my practice to further contemplate on the multifaceted layers of evocative clothing.
