				Clothing is one of the most intimate things in our lives. It is what we wear closest to our bodies. We allow few other items to come into such direct contact with our skin. <span class="image-anchor" data-image-id="reveal1">Chiharu Shiota</span>, an artist who uses clothing as one of her main instruments to explore intangible themes of memory and existence, once said clothing is a second skin because they hold such power to express about each of us. Our memories, too, are intimate, personal and subjective. They are tinted by positive or negative emotions, sometimes also by trauma, loss or fear, and can be evoked by smell, color or tactility. All of this is why clothing is an ideal carrier of and portal to our memories.

				Since young, I have always had an interesting relationship with clothing. I distinctly remember when I was 9, I had to stop at a public restroom in a random building on my way to school to change into the clothes I packed in my bag from what my mom dressed for me. My predilection for clothing was prominent all throughout my years of childhood and adolescence. There is a family website/blog/diary my dad has been managing since before my birth up until now. He used to be an avid photographer for our family and friends which explains all the photos he has taken since the very first camera he got are archived to this site. It is an old habit of mine in which I would visit the archive that is under perpetual construction whenever I am bored or in need of pure entertainment. The photos taken by my dad never fail to amuse me for many reasons but one of them is that at first glance, I distinctly remember the clothes and the attachment I had for the pieces from the past. And just like that, my memories are vividly recalled simply by looking at these clothes of mine and of my parents.

				<span class="image-anchor" data-image-id="reveal2">The first step to this exploration/study was to visit this exhibition titled ECHO.</span> Wrapped in Memory at MoMu, a fashion museum in Antwerp, Belgium. As Momu eloquently explains their vision, “Fashion is more than clothing, and more than “fashion”. It’s a prism to look at the world from different angles. One of the roles of contemporary fashion is to push the meaning of the term “fashion” and move beyond the canonized narratives of fashion history. People need a place where fashion is subject to reflection and criticism. A haven to calmly observe the philosophy and dynamics behind fashion, its history and its future. A place to explore what fashion is, and what it does to us.” An exhibition that couldn’t be more perfectly aligned with the theme I’m exploring, ECHO. Wrapped in Memory explores the relationship between clothing and memory through the lens of Louise Bourgeois, Simone Rocha, and Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker. I made a trip to Antwerp to see ECHO. during the winter break of 2023-2024 before my last semester at school. When you enter the first room of the exhibition, the space greets you with pitch black walls and ceiling and several spotlights shining onto Pregnant Woman (2003) by Louise Bourgeois. Then, you walk through a tunnel draped with red velvet fabrics, entering a bigger space where the real journey begins. ECHO’s set designer, Janina Pedan, hoped to evoke memories not only by the artworks, clothes, and stories but also through the materiality, acoustics, and lighting to bring out the ultimate evocative experience.

				Let’s start with this work by Louise Bourgeois.

				Lousie Bourgeois describes how she had her ‘pink days and blue days’ just like everyone does. We all have our good days and bad days. On her pink days she felt an intense surge of femininity, creativity, optimism, positivity, and affirmation, while blue days were days of melancholy, contemplation, and withdrawal. Bourgeois uses her own old garments transfused with the memories of good and bad, days of the past tinted with pink and blue. Clothes were a source of joy and even greater friction to her for a long time. As quoted in Charlie Porter’s What Artists Wear, in 1969 Bourgeois wrote in her notes, “it gives me great pleasure to keep my clothes, my dresses, my stockings... It’s my past, and as rotten as it is I would like to take it and hold it tight in my arms.” The quote clearly depicts Bourgeois’ unique love for her clothes and the memories wrapped in them. Later she describes these possessions as burdensome, representing “failures, rejects abandoned.” Pink Days and Blue Days explores her childhood and her family history, in particular, the traumatic impact of her parents’ troubled marriage and her father’s affair. According to Bourgeois, the bones that hang the lace baby gown in this work represent the “bone of contention” which symbolizes the rivalry between her parents to earn her affection by buying her clothing. As Charlie Porter further explains, “Bourgeois was in tune with the emotion and trauma that we instill in our clothes, and the toll of letting them go.” Pink Days and Blue Days is the perfect embodiment of the human experience in which we try to hold onto clothes and the memories of the pink of the pink days but also, the inevitable desire to rid of those from the blue days exists.  In 1995, Bourgeois finally managed to let them go, transferring most of her clothes to her studio where she could turn them into raw, sculptural material which allowed the weight of the past to be lifted: "the cord was cut and I felt dizzy – the history of the wardrobe had started.” The act of letting go comes with great therapeutic release, the trauma and the clothes, which brought a psychological shift in her, emancipating herself from her childhood. Jerry Gorovoy, Bourgeois’ studio assistant, who helped her to bring the contents of the upstairs wardrobes down to her basement studio said Bourgeois’s deep urge to embark on this new body of work came from her getting older and wondering what would happen to all the objects she had saved throughout her life. I, a self-proclaimed hoarder, often imagine what I will do with the miscellany have had been cherished by me. In this case, Bourgeois sets a great example by taking her childhood artefacts that are linked to deep-seated emotions and memories into a powerful evocative work.

				<span class="image-anchor" data-image-id="reveal3">Chiharu Shiota is Osaka-born</span>, Berlin-based artist that explores intangible concepts such as memory, dreams, anxiety, and silence. Knotted threads are a primary material present throughout her installations, which have become her signature, questioning notions of human existence and transcendence. With Memory under The Skin, Chiharu Shiota explores one of her favorite themes: clothing as “second skin”. She explains that clothes “can even be more important than skin because they offer the opportunity to express so much about each of us. They say more than a person’s skin color, age or nationality. They are always with us in our daily life, becoming the personification of our memories, our existence. When we die, our existence is reflected by our clothes and the objects we surround ourselves with. Existence in absence: it is one of the themes of my work.
